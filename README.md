## What Makes This Different

- **Real Storytelling**: Not a documentary or podcast format, but genuine narrative storytelling with dramatic arcs, tension, and revelations
- **Immersive Narration**: Cinematic, evocative voice that paints vivid mental images
- **Infinite Stories**: Stories flow seamlessly from one epic to another, creating an endless tapestry of tales
- **AI-Powered Research**: Deep dive into real facts and historical details to create authentic, compelling narratives
- **Multi-Language Support**: Choose between English and French for your storytelling experience

## How It Works

1. **Enter a subject**: Tell the AI what story you want to hear (e.g., "The Epic of Alexander the Great", "The Fall of Rome", "The French Revolution")
2. **Choose your language**: Select English or French for the narration
3. **Listen and immerse**: The AI structures a multi-chapter narrative, researches dramatic details, writes captivating scripts, and narrates them with voice synthesis
